# Questions
- This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project?
Mel: In the planning phases for each method and class, we outlined what was required, what the correct order of execution should be, and took notes. We also made an outline of what methods we thought we would require and where different functions/behaviors/methods/whatever would go in the game.

- If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?


- Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
Mel: We used async work as well as driver/navigator depending on the complexity of the task at hand. All of the classes except Game and simpler methods in Game were written in async work, while our more complicated methods -- like methods checking for different win conditions -- were done together.

- Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
Over the project, we communicated almost always over a video call. 
Mel: The feedback and advisement I was given was constructive, informative, and very helpful. Jess is great at explaining things.
