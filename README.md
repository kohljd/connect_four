# Reflection Questions
**This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project?**<br>
- In the planning phases, we reviewed how the game is played and requirements to come up with a list of potential classes and methods. We outlined what these methods and classes would need as well as the overall game control flow. Comments were added in the files as to what code should be written in them and how the functions should behave. As issues arose throughout the project, we regularly compared ideas and potential solutions via slack messages and video calls.

**If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?**<br>
- Refactoring. Add option for 2 players and allow players to input a name. It'd also be nice to make the X's and O's different colors to improve board readability.

**Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.**<br>
- Both asynchronous work and driver/navigator pair techniques were used depending on the complexity of the task at hand. More involved Game methods such as checking winning conditions were completed together. The remaining work (tests, simpler methods, bug fixes, etc.) was completed asynchronously.

**Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.**<br>
- Over the project, we communicated almost always over a video call for feedback.
- Mel: The feedback and advisement I was given was constructive, informative, and very helpful. Jess is great at explaining things.
- Jess: Feedback was given well constructed and helpful. Overall communication was very good.
